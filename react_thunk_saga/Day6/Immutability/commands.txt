npm install --save-dev babel-core babel-cli babel-preset-es2015
npm install --save-dev mocha chai

This command tells Mocha to recursively find all tests from the project and run
them. It uses Babel to transpile ES6 code before running it.
It'll be easier in the long run to store this command in our package.json:

"scripts": {
"test": "mocha --compilers js:babel-core/register --recursive"
},


Another thing we need to do is enable Babel's ES6/ES2015 language support. It's
done by activating the babel-preset-es2015 package that we already installed.
We just need to add a "babel" section to package.json:

"babel": {
"presets": ["es2015"]
}

npm install --save immutable
